# Learn Software Architecture for Long-Term Maintainability

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates how to design and implement software architectures that support long-term maintainability. While the app itself is a finance management tool, the primary focus is on applying advanced architectural principles to enhance scalability, readability, and maintainability in real-world projects.

## Target Audience

This material is tailored for students and medium-advanced developers interested in improving their understanding of:
- Service architectures
- Custom React hooks
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Design patterns
- Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs)
